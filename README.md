# 📁 FilesByDate 

Transform your messy file collections into perfectly organized date-based folders with just a few clicks!

## What Does This Application Do?

Having struggled with thousands of photos or files unorganized, I decided to create this application which automatically sorts your files by their creation dates, organizing them into neat, date-labeled folders. Whether you have years of  photos, documents, or other files, you can now organize them effortlessly. This structure can easily help you structure you photos by dates, which can be easier for finding and editing videos

**Example**
```
Source Folder/
├── photo1.jpg (date: 2024-01-15)
├── photo2.jpg (date: 2024-01-16)
├── photo3.jpg (date: 2024-01-16)
└── photo4.jpg (date: 2024-01-17)

Destination Folder/
├── 15-01-2024/
│   └── photo1.jpg
├── 16-01-2024/
│   ├── photo2.jpg
│   └── photo3.jpg
└── 17-01-2024/
    └── photo4.jpg
```


## How It Works

### **Simple 4-Step Process**

**Step 1: Point to Your Messy Folder**

Choose the target folder that contains all your unsorted files(copy or move it there) - whether it's your Downloads folder, a photo collection, or any other directory with scattered files.

**Step 2: Choose Where to Organize**

Select a destination folder where you want your perfectly organized date folders to be created.

**Step 3: Pick Your Date Style**

Choose how you want your date folders named:
- 15-01-2024 (Day-Month-Year)
- 01-15-2024 (Month-Day-Year) 
- 2024-01-15 (Year-Month-Day)

**Step 4:**

Click "Copy" to keep your original files safe, or "Move" to clean up your source folder completely.

### **What You'll Get**
Before: One messy folder with hundreds of unsorted files  
After: Neat date-based folders, each containing files from that specific day


> **Tip:** While this application was originally designed with photo organization in mind, it works perfectly with any file type! Documents, videos, downloads, music files - anything can be automatically sorted by date. The smart date detection ensures your files end up in the right folders regardless of their format.
